<h1>Stacks</h1>
<h3>Definations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>stack can be defined as a container in which insertion and deletion can be done from the one end known as the top of the stack.</li>
  <li>Stack is a data structure that follows the LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out) principle</li>
  <li>It means which element is inserted last that element is deleted first from that stack or which element inserted first that element deleted last from the stack</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stack Operations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>push(): When we insert an element in a stack then the operation is known as a push. If the stack is full then the overflow condition occurs.</li>
  <li>pop(): When we delete an element from the stack, the operation is known as a pop. If the stack is empty means that no element exists in the stack, this state is known as an underflow state.</li>
  <li>isEmpty(): It determines whether the stack is empty or not.</li>
  <li>isFull(): It determines whether the stack is full or not.</li>
  <li>peek(): It returns the element at the given position.</li>
  <li>count(): It returns the total number of elements available in a stack.</li>
  <li>change(): It changes the element at the given position.</li>
  <li>display(): It prints all the elements available in the stack</li>
</ul>
